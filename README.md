# elixr

elixr is a very simple utility library for bukkit-based plugins, developed by _viveleroi_ of dhmc. 

It contains extracted code often shared between our plugins, including Prism, Craftys, DarkMythos, Inventory Toolkit, Darmok, and more.

**Currently in dev status as we clean it up and synchronize all of our utils with it. Don't use elixr yet unless you're Viveleroi. ;)**

You may include the package with your plugin via maven, our repo is at:
